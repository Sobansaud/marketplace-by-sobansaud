ðŸš€ Hackathon Day 3: API Integration & Data Migration

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed Day 3 of the Hackathon, where my primary focus was on API Integration and Data Migration into Sanity CMS for building a fully functional backend for my furniture eCommerce project. This was a pivotal step in creating a dynamic, scalable platform capable of handling real-time data from external sources.

Key Learning Outcomes:
API Integration in Next.js: I learned how to integrate various APIs into a Next.js project, which is crucial for fetching live data such as product listings, categories, and order history. By connecting the backend with external APIs, the platform can dynamically display real-time information to users. It was an essential step towards creating a modern, headless eCommerce architecture.

Data Migration to Sanity CMS: One of the major tasks was to migrate existing data into Sanity CMS. This involved carefully adjusting my Sanity schema to ensure it aligned perfectly with the API data. For example, I mapped fields such as product_title in the API to the name field in my Sanity schema. Ensuring data consistency and integrity during this process was critical for seamless integration.

Schema Validation and Adjustment: After reviewing the API documentation, I spent time comparing the schema from Sanity CMS to the incoming data structure. This process involved updating field types, names, and relationships to ensure compatibility, which allowed for smooth migration of the data. This step also helped me learn how to handle complex data relationships in a headless CMS setup.

Exploring Different Migration Methods: I explored several methods for migrating data:

Using Provided APIs: I wrote scripts to fetch and transform data from external APIs.
Manual Import: For smaller datasets, I experimented with exporting data as JSON/CSV and uploading it to Sanity manually.
External Platform APIs: I also integrated APIs from platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce, mapping fields to my Sanity schema for a customized migration process.
Error Handling & Testing: Ensuring robust error handling is a crucial part of any API integration. I implemented error logging and fallback mechanisms to ensure the frontend could still function even if some data failed to load. Testing was carried out using Postman and browser developer tools to ensure that the API calls were consistent and error-free.

Tools & Resources:
Template 6 API: Used for importing product data into Sanity CMS. The API URL I worked with is:
https://template6-six.vercel.app/api/products
Sanity CMS: To manage the content and structure of my eCommerce platform.
Next.js: For integrating APIs and rendering data on the frontend.
Postman & Browser Developer Tools: For testing API calls and ensuring data consistency.
Challenges & Solutions:
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the schema in Sanity CMS was compatible with the data format provided by the API. I had to make a few adjustments to the schema to handle complex relationships and ensure smooth data transformation. Another challenge was testing large datasets for accuracy, but with careful error handling and validation, I was able to overcome this smoothly.

Next Steps:
Moving forward, I will continue refining the integration to ensure the front end consistently displays accurate product listings, categories, and other relevant data. Iâ€™m also working on adding features like real-time inventory tracking and order management to further enhance the eCommerce experience.

Reflections:
This experience has been invaluable in helping me understand the complexities of API integration, data migration, and schema management within a headless CMS environment. It has provided me with real-world skills in handling diverse data sources, working with APIs, and building dynamic, scalable eCommerce platforms.

Looking forward to continuing the journey and learning more on the next day of the hackathon! ðŸ’¡ðŸ”§
